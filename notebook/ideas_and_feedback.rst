Simultaneously evolve tRNA and aaRS
===================================
- I was reading about the role of EF-Tu in proofreading: "EF-Tu • GTP binds all 
  correctly-charged aa-tRNAs with approximately identical affinity, except 
  those charged with initiation residues and selenocysteine.[9][10] This can be 
  accomplished because although different amino acid residues have varying 
  side-chain properties, the tRNAs associated with those residues have varying 
  structures to compensate for differences in side-chain binding 
  affinities.[11][12]" [Wikipedia]

- This implies that the tRNA has to be optimized for the amino acid.

  - A counter point to this idea: "The aminoacyl-binding site of EF-Tu and the 
    ribosome are highly promiscuous (in vitro and in vivo translation 
    experiments have demonstrated that the range of acceptable substrates 
    includes many noncanonical amino acid side chains as well as D-amino acids 
    and even α-hydroxy acids where ester rather than amide backbone bonds are 
    formed) (61)." [Liu2010]_

  - Also related: "It is also possible to develop EF-Tu mutants that better 
    tolerate UAAs, especially those with large side chains or altered 
    backbones. This has been demonstrated in an in vitro translation system 
    with rationally designed EF-Tu variants that have mutations in their 
    aminoacyl-binding pockets (160)." [Liu2010]_

- This could be done in a screen prior to designing the aaRS:

  - Chemically attached the desired NCAA to a CCA oligo [Roesser1989]_, 
    [Robertson1989]_, [Noren1989]_, [Heckler1984]_, [Hecht1978]_

  - In vitro transcribe a library of tRNA molecules, e.g. with mutated acceptor 
    stems.

  - Ligate the CCA-NCAA to the tRNA library.

  - Pull-down with EF-Tu

  - Reverse transcribe and sequence.
