Backbone movement
*****************

An important consideration is how much backbone flexibility to incorporate in 
the design simulations.  To get a sense for this, I want to start by comparing 
all the crystal structures available for MjTyrRS and MmPylRS, to see how much 
the backbone changes when modest numbers of mutations are made.

M. mazei PylRS
==============
- Binding pocket:

  - Very little backbone movement overall.
  - Slightly more movement in the loop at the base of the pocket, but that 
    could also be due to crystal contacts.
  - First impression is that backrub would be good.

- ATP: very little movement.

- Amino acid: 

  - Lots of heterogeneity
  - I probably want to design with the adenylated ligand, because I can use the 
    adenylate as an anchor.

M. jannaschii TyrRS
===================
- Few structures include adenylate.

  - But I'll assume that anchoring the adenylate is still a good idea.

- The α-helix making most direct contact with the ligand is often substantially 
  remodeled.

  - Examples:

    - 1zh0
    - 2ag6
    - 3d6u
    - 3d6v
    - 5u36

  - Might help accommodate bigger substrates.
  - fKIC could be very good for this.
  - Curious how [Baumann2019]_ dealt with this.

- The β-sheet is always in the same conformation, perhaps with a little more 
  heterogeneity than M. mazei PylRS.
