A pymol session containing all of the TyrRS structures in the PDB, aligned.

What I did:

- Search PDB for the following:

  - "Full text" contains "tyrrs"
  - "Structure attribute/polymer entity description" contains "Tyrosyl-tRNA 
    synthetase"
  - "Structure attribute/polymer entity description" contains "Tyrosine-tRNA 
    ligase"
  
- Find 101 hits.

  - Several of these hits are TrpRS or HisRS structures, included because of 
    the full text search term.

  - The HisRS structures (class IIa) can't be aligned to the TyrRS structures, 
    so I removed them from the pymol session.

  - I kept the TrpRS structures, just in the interest of having more points of 
    comparison.

- Download all.

- In pymol:

  - Run `load.pml`

    - This tries to align everything, but doesn't do a great job.

  - For every structure:

    - Manually check alignment to 1d2r, and redo if necessary.
    - Manually delete extra chains.
    - Manually delete structures that can't be aligned.

  - Save session.
